# YAPS - Yet Another Picture Sorter ![](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/poliakustyczny/YAPS/master.svg)

## About
 
YAPS is an app written in python to help manage large collection of pictures. It provides both GUI and CLI interfaces.
Take an account that app is still in pre-alpha stage and a lot of functions does not work or is not implemented.

## Installation

For now the best way to install app is to install manually `python 3.6`, `pip` and `python tkinter` libs,
then install `pipenv` via `pip` and download other dependencies via `pipfile`
Detailed guide or install script TBA :)
